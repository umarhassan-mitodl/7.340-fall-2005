Assignment 1: Build a Capsid Model
----------------------------------

You have been given a hexagonal lattice of humanoid figures (a homuncu-lattice, if you will) representing capsid subunits printed onto 11" x 17" card stock. Your assignment is to cut out triangular faces of the lattice and construct an icosahedron representing a capsid shell of a T number of your choosing. Pick one of these T numbers only: 7, 9, or 12. The face sizes will be determined by your chosen T number.

Assignment 2: Designing a Set of Experiments for a given Abstract
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You are given a sample abstract from a scientific paper and are asked to design a set of experiments that would support the conclusions presented in it.

Sample abstract and guidelines for your experimental design ({{% resource_link 7a5b20bb-bd44-ee47-a38a-a7ad798e72b3 "PDF" %}})

Assignment 3: Independent Research Proposal
-------------------------------------------

As you progress in your scientific career (especially if you continue on in academia), you will be asked many times to develop and design independent research proposals. A considerable amount of work goes into designing a rational set of experiments before you ever venture into the lab to perform them. Research proposals are often required for fellowship and grant applications so financers of said experiments can see you have thought about the problem at hand in a logical way. This is a chance for you to practice the techniques involved in developing a set of experiments to solve a biological problem.
