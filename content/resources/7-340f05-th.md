  caption: Structure of the Salmonella bacteriophage epsilon15 as determined by a
    symmetry-free reconstruction of an 11,000 particle dataset obtained by cryo-electron
    microscopy. An icosahedral shell consisting of 415 copies of capsid protein encloses
    a 39.7 kilobase dsDNA genome. This reconstruction method also allows the visualization
    of the complex of proteins that make up the phage's tail. The club like appendages
    recognize and bind lipopolysaccharide on the surface of Salmonella and anchor
    the phage to its host during the first steps of infection. (Image kindly provided
