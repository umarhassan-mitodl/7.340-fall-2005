description: Structure of the Salmonella bacteriophage epsilon15 as determined by
  a symmetry-free reconstruction of an 11,000 particle dataset obtained by cryo-electron
  microscopy. An icosahedral shell consisting of 415 copies of capsid protein encloses
  a 39.7 kilobase dsDNA genome. This reconstruction method also allows the visualization
  of the complex of proteins that make up the phage's tail. The club like appendages
  recognize and bind lipopolysaccharide on the surface of Salmonella and anchor the
  phage to its host during the first steps of infection. (Image kindly provided by
